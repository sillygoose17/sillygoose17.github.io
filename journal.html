<h2>Entry 1</h2>
<p>Today I finished my person card using html and css. I used two gifs, one of a concert and one of a drum and I used a ease-in-out transition between them. Along with that, I finished hyperlinking my home page to my projects and journal page and I experienced with different transitions. I am struggling with getting a div for a menu bar.</p>

<br>

<h3>Entry 2</h3>
<p>Now, I began working on my menu and utilizing hover affects in order to change the colors. I also made a menu bar in my journal and worked on centering the text and using line breaks. I also tried to use divs in order to make a background image for my index page. I found an image of instruments and used that as a background but I struggled with placing it below the menu bar as it keeps being placed above. Lastly, I've worked on changing font size, type, and color.
