<h1>Caden Castro-Kudler Journal</h1>

<h2>Entry 1</h2>
Today I finished my person card using html and css. I used two gifs, one of a concert and one of a drum and I used a ease-in-out transition between them. Along with that, I finished hyperlinking my home page to my projects and journal page and I experienced with different transitions. I am struggling with getting a div for a menu bar.
