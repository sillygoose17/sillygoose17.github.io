<h2>Entry 1</h2>
<p>Today I finished my person card using html and css. I used two gifs, one of a concert and one of a drum and I used a ease-in-out transition between them. Along with that, I finished hyperlinking my home page to my projects and journal page and I experienced with different transitions. I am struggling with getting a div for a menu bar.</p>

<br>

<h3>Entry 2</h3>
<p>Now, I began working on my menu and utilizing hover affects in order to change the colors. I also made a menu bar in my journal and worked on centering the text and using line breaks. I also tried to use divs in order to make a background image for my index page. I found an image of instruments and used that as a background but I struggled with placing it below the menu bar as it keeps being placed above. Lastly, I've worked on changing font size, type, and color.
</p>
<h4>Entry 3</h4>
<p>This entry is to celebrate the eureka moments I've just had! I have spent an hour and a half tonight working on stylistic elements of my website and hyperlinks too. I feel a lot more comfortable using CSS and HTML than I thought I would. I also created an animation of a circular shape that changes color and moves and am moderately proud of that. I also began to hyperlink things to my project page and my next project is to create of a music note moving around the home page that can be hyperlinked!

<h5>Entry 4</h5>
<p>Recently, I have been working on editting my projects page in order to make it more visually appealing. I used more CSS in order to code it. I have also been working on understanding variables, functions, and event listeners, and have been watching videos in order to help. I applied this understanding to a project where squares would appear in different colors and if clicked on, would disappear.</p>

<h6>Entry 5</h6>
<p>I have continued to familiarize myself with javascript as a language as I feel comfortable in CSS yet feel apprehensive in java. I have made another project using an event listener, this time inspired by a stormy day. Furthermore, I used multiple event listeners and utilized a gif. I also have began working on my square quilt by changing the colors and adding images to different squares. The collection and insertion of every process was tedius but I am proud of the product! </p>
<h6>Entry 6</h6>
<p>My favorite project so far has been the array! I was inspired by a tiktok trend that I was doing with my friends and I thought I could apply it to javascript. The radomization aspect made sense and was easy to understand but the harder part was successfully making the emojis appear where I clicked. Despite this, after guidance from Molly, it began to work and it came out exactly how I wanted it to!</p>
